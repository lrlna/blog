I am a software engineer working in javascript, nodejs and rust. Originally born in southern
Ukraine, I grew up in Vancouver, Canada, and now reside in Berlin.

Outside of writing code in the code editorâ„¢, I makes zines (such as [Data
Ownership in
Rust](https://github.com/lrlna/sketchin/blob/master/zines/data-ownership.md),
[Traits Traits
Traits](https://github.com/lrlna/sketchin/blob/master/zines/rust-traits.md),
[Rust+Wasm](https://github.com/lrlna/sketchin/blob/master/zines/rust-wasm.md),
[Event Loop in
JS](https://github.com/lrlna/sketchin/blob/master/zines/js-event-loop.md)), pet
my cats Chashu and Nori, and maintains (give or take) 40 house plants.

Occasionally I give talks at conferences about my various programming
adventures. Some of them include:
- [From Electron, to Wasm, to Rust (Aaand Back to
  Electron)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLzFJenzBng) at RustConf in
  Portland
